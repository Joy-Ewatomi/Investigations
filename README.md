## 🎓 Key Lessons Learned

**From Tesla Investigation (Day 12):**
> OSINT isn't about fancy tools, it's about systematic methodology, patience, and ethical research practices.

**From Reverse Image Search (Day 18):**
> Same image appears across multiple sites, often without credit. Reverse search reveals the truth.

**From Username Enumeration (Day 19):**
> Tools find usernames. Investigators verify identity. One username can belong to dozens of people, verification methodology is everything.

**From Phone OSINT (Day 22):**
> Phone numbers are identity gateways. Understanding phone OSINT serves dual purpose, investigators can verify information, users can understand what they're exposing.

**From Domain Intelligence (Day 25):**
> OSINT isn't just social media, it's understanding the digital infrastructure behind every online presence.

**From Security Blue Team Challenge:**
> Real investigations require systematic evidence collection across multiple sources. One tool isn't enough, you need methodology.
